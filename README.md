### What Is This?

### A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that attempts to make an online service unavailable by sending large number of dummy data requests.
And overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources
from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information
